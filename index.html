                <h7> 🎬 Phullwanti</h7>
                <p>Phullwanti is not just a movie, it’s a full-on cultural mic drop. Rooted in Maharashtra’s rich tradition, the film brings Lavani, power, patriarchy, and rebellion together in one bold, emotionally charged story.

Set in a traditional social setup, Phullwanti follows a fierce Lavani performer who refuses to live by rules written to silence her. She’s graceful on stage, fearless off it, and constantly pushing back against a society that wants her talent—but not her freedom. The film explores how art becomes resistance and how a woman’s voice can shake systems that have stood unchallenged for generations.

Visually, the movie is a treat—authentic costumes, raw village aesthetics, and Lavani performances that feel electric, not decorative. Emotionally, it hits hard, questioning honor, respect, and who really gets to decide a woman’s worth.</p>
